# Complaint-Assistance-System
In the Hostel complaint system followed widely, the average time for the complaint to be resolved is higher than tolerable.
Also categorizing the complaints and assigning the respective domain experts to deal with the complaints is quite a task 
and further contributes to the complaint resolution time.

Hence this Web-Based Complaint Assistance System which has an accessible registration website for the Students to register complaints, 
regularly track these complaints and also to check the status of the complaints they have registered.
 Along with this there is a website for the warden to process the complaint and assign the respective worker to 
 resolve the complaint and he also has access to adding and removing Employees.
 
 We have an analysis system for the warden to monitor the efficiency of various departments concerned to resolve complaints, 
 various individuals and also to update the status of complaints.
 
Furthermore, there is a Login Page for the Employee who can login and 
check the details of all the Complaints that he has been assigned with.

Once the Complaint has been resolved the employee can then submit a report to the warden 
providing him the details of the Complaint and then the Warden can update the status of the complaint. 
This will then be checked by the Student and also physically verified by the respective officials.
